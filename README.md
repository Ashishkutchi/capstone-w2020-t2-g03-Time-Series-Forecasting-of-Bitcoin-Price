This is the Git repository for the Capstone Project by Ashish Kutchi, Fangyi Yu, Obie Udemezue and Yiqi Zhang, under the supervision of Marcos Bittencourt
Our project explores the use of time-series forecasting methods to predict the price of Bitcoin, using machine learning. Organizations, markets and industries are daily in
of the ability to accurately predict the performance of their value drivers, and time-series forecasting leveraging on machine learning algorithms have made this possible.

Although Cryptocurrencies have been tagged by financial experts as the future of transactions, Bitcoin, which is the most popular and acceptable cryptocurrency has a very 
volatile price trend, making it challenging for this method of transaction to gain the trust of its users. By providing accurate predictions of Bitcoin prices, we intend 
increasing the trust of both those who simply use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions or investors seeking to make profits from Bitcoin as every other money market.

We chose to tackle a time-series challenge as we believe that the approach can be easily replicated by various organizations operating in diverse sectors
